		  Environment (ALE): both a challenge problem and a platform
		  and methodology for evaluating the development of general,
		  domain-independent AI technology. ALE provides an interface
		  to hundreds of Atari 2600 game environments, each one
		  different, interesting, and designed to be a challenge for
		  human players. ALE presents significant research challenges
		  for reinforcement learning, model learning, model-based
		  planning, imitation learning, transfer learning, and
		  intrinsic motivation. Most importantly, it provides a
		  rigorous testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to
		  these problems. We illustrate the promise of ALE by
		  developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents
		  designed using well-established AI techniques for both
		  reinforcement learning and planning. In doing so, we also
		  propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE,
		  reporting empirical results on over 55 different games. All
		  of the software, including the benchmark agents, is
		  publicly available.},

  abstract	= {In this paper we propose a novel policy for steering
		  multiple vehicles between assigned independent start and
		  goal configurations and ensuring collision avoidance. The
		  policy rests on the assumption that agents are all
		  cooperating by implementing the same traffic rules.
		  However, the policy is completely decentralized, as each
		  agent decides its own motion by applying those rules only
		  on locally available information, and totally scalable, in
		  the sense that the amount of information processed by each
		  agent and the computational complexity of the algorithms
		  are not increasing with the number of agents in the
		  scenario. The proposed policy applies to systems in which
		  new vehicle may enter the scene and start interacting with
		  existing ones at any time, while others may leave. Under
		  mild conditions on the initial configurations, the policy
		  is shown to be safe, i.e. to guarantee collision avoidance
		  throughout the system evolution. In the paper, conditions
		  are discussed on the desired configurations of agents under
		  which the ultimate convergence of all vehicles to their
		  goals can also be guaranteed. To show that such conditions
		  are actually necessary and sufficient, which turns out to
		  be a challenging liveness verification problem for a
		  complex hybrid automaton, we employ a probabilistic
		  verification method. The paper finally reports on
		  simulations for systems of several tens of vehicles, and
		  with some experimental implementation showing the
		  practicality of the approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents scalable parallel BDD operations for modern multi-core hardware. We aim at increasing the performance of reachability analysis in the context of model checking. Existing approaches focus on performing multiple independent BDD operations rather than parallelizing the BDD operations themselves. In the past, attempts at parallelizing BDD operations have been unsuccessful due to communication costs in shared memory. We solved this problem by extending an existing lockless hashtable to support BDDs and garbage collection and by implementing a lockless memoization table. Using these lockless hashtables and the work-stealing framework Wool, we implemented a multi-core BDD package called Sylvan. We provide the experimental results of using this multi-core BDD package in the framework of the model checker LTSmin. We measured the runtime of the reachability algorithm on several models from the BEEM model database on a 48-core machine, demonstrating speedups of over 30 for some models, which is a breakthrough compared to earlier work. In addition, we improved the standard symbolic reachability algorithm to use a modified BDD operatcion that calculates the relational product and the variable substitution in one step. We show that this new algorithm improves the performance of symbolic reachability and decreases the memory requirements by up to 40{\%}. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
